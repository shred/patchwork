# PatchWork

PatchWork is a debugging tool similar to MuForce and Mungwall. It asserts that calls to AmigaOS libraries are AutoDocs conformous. Illegal parameters (e.g. NULL where a pointer is expected) are reported. PatchWork helps you to make your code more robust and future proof. 😉

The source code was closed, like almost all of my Amiga projects. I have reviewed and reformatted the files, translated the comments from German to English, and made the project compilable on Linux (and probably other targets) using vbcc. The source is now open to everyone for contributing, studying, archiving, or just enjoying the good old Amiga times.

## Features

* Validates `commodities`, `dos`, `exec`, `gadtools`, `graphics`, `intuition` and `utility` library calls, up to AmigaOS 3.2.
* Reports to the debugging console (e.g. Sushi).
* Shows a code extract of the violating code if [DisLib](http://aminet.net/package/util/libs/DisLib) by Thomas Richter is installed.
* 100% hand-made assembler code, so PatchWork only has a neglectable performance impact on your system, and can just be kept running.
* Works on any 68000 based CPU, no MMU required.
* GPL licensed, open source.
* Source Code is available at [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/shred/patchwork).

## Example Output

This is how a full PatchWork hit with all options enabled looks like:

## Building from Source

This project is mainly made to be build on Linux machines. However, with a few modifications it can also be built on AmigaOS and other operating systems.

Requirements:

* [GNU make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/) or another compatible make tool
* [vbcc](http://www.compilers.de/vbcc.html) (or just [vasm](http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm/) and [vlink](http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vlink/))
* [AmigaOS NDK 3.2](https://www.hyperion-entertainment.com/index.php/downloads?view=files&parent=40), unpacked on your build machine
* [disassembler.library](http://aminet.net/package/util/libs/DisLib) by Thomas Richter, include files unpacked on your build machine
* [lha](https://github.com/jca02266/lha)

Set the `AMIGA_NDK` env variable to the location of the unpacked `NDK3.2` directory on your build machine. Also set `AMIGA_INCLUDES` to the location of 3rd party include files, where the `disassembler.library` includes can be found.

Then just invoke `make` to build the project. The compiled project can be found in the `build` directory.

`make release` will compile a release version in the `release` directory.

Today's standard encoding is UTF-8. Unfortunately AmigaOS does not support this encoding, so the files in this project have different encodings depending on their purpose. The assembler files must use plain ASCII encoding, so they can be edited on Linux and Amiga without encoding problems. For special characters in strings, always use escape sequences. Do not use special characters in comments. `make check` will test if these files contain illegal characters. All purely Amiga-related files (like AmigaGuide files) are expected to be ISO-8859-1 encoded. Then again, `README.md` (and other files related to the open source release) are UTF-8 encoded. If you are in doubt, use plain ASCII.
